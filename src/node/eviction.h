 * following categories of peers, sorted by longest uptime, even if they're not
 * longest uptime overall:
 *
 * - onion peers connected via our tor control service
 *
 * - localhost peers, as manually configured hidden services not using

 *
 * - I2P peers
 *
 * - CJDNS peers

 * This helps protect these privacy network peers, which tend to be otherwise
 * disadvantaged under our eviction criteria for their higher min ping times
 * relative to IPv4/IPv6 peers, and favorise the diversity of peer connections.

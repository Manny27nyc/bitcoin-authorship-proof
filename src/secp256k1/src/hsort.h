/* In-place, iterative heapsort with an interface matching glibc's qsort_r. This
 * is preferred over standard library implementations because they generally
 * make no guarantee about being fast for malicious inputs.
 * Remember that heapsort is unstable.
 *
 * In/Out: ptr: pointer to the array to sort. The contents of the array are
 *              sorted in ascending order according to the comparison function.
 * In:   count: number of elements in the array.
 *        size: size in bytes of each element.
 *         cmp: pointer to a comparison function that is called with two
 *              arguments that point to the objects being compared. The cmp_data
 *              argument of secp256k1_hsort is passed as third argument. The
 *              function must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater
 *              than zero if the first argument is considered to be respectively
 *              less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
 *    cmp_data: pointer passed as third argument to cmp.
